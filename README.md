# The Backend Engineering Handbook

This repository will be primarily a series of articles meant to serve as a concise handbook to backend engineering. The structure of it is based on the roadmap.sh's popular [Backend Roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/backend). The reason for this repository is that while roadmap.sh's guide is wonderful:

- It's collaborative nature means the writing style is not necessarily consistent
- As user submissions are accepted, and information is numerous

I would like to provide a cohesive set of articles that can be read front to back to a reader who would like a general overview of the subject.

## Structure

The bulk of this repository will be in the /markdown directory. Each article will be numbered.

Any static supplementary material (i.e. images) should be in the /public directory.

Any dynamic material (i.e. web-application, demo) should be in the /src directory.

## Style

### Overall

This material is meant to be concise and accessible. Think "<subject> for Dummies".
It is not meant to be highly detailed, supplementary material will be provided to the reader for futher reading.
If the material is very technical, it should part of later sections after the reader has built some understanding.

### Articles

Articles are meant to be read in succession, however, each article should stand on its own for readers who just need a quick reference on a subject.

Each article:

- should begin with an introduction
- should take no more than 15 minutes to read for someone familiar with the material, and no more than 30 minutes to read for someone who maybe new to the subject.
- should provide a summary for readers to structure the topic in their mind
- should provide some extra material for those who require more detailed reading.

## Corrections/Submissions/Questions

Feel free to submit an issue or PR if you find any mistakes, inquiries, etc.
